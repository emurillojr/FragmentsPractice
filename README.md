Fragment inclass <br>
Create two fragments <br>
•	One Blank Fragment <br>
•	One List Fragment <br>
The specs for the blank fragment are the following: <br>
•	The user will type text into a textbox and then click on a button.   <br>
That text will appear in the main activity as a toast statement.  <br> 
Note, the toast method must be in the MainActivity, not the fragment. <br>
 <br>
The specs for the list fragment are the following: <br>
•	When the user clicks on a list item, the contents of that item will be displayed as a toast message in the MainActivity. <br>
•	That text will also appear in the blank fragment’s text box. <br>
 <br>
A couple of notes: <br>
•	Take the default DummyContent for the Fragment list. <br>
•	Take all the defaults you can for the Fragment list. <br>
•	Don’t forget to implement the fragment listeners in the MainActivity <br>
